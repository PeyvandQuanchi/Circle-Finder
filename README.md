# OverView

Given a binary image containing a white circle on a black background, the algorithms search the pixel space to identify the target region. This notebook serves as a practical implementation of uninformed and informed search strategies in a visual and interpretable context.

IDS: A depth-limited version of DFS that increases the depth limit iteratively. Suitable for scenarios with unknown solution depth.

A*: An informed search algorithm that uses a heuristic function to efficiently guide the search toward the goal.

# Key Concepts

* State representation using pixel coordinates

* Goal recognition based on color thresholding

* Search path visualization

* Heuristic design for A* (e.g., Euclidean distance to the goal)

* Comparison of performance (e.g., explored nodes)
